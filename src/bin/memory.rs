//MEMORY
//memory is stored using binary (bits: 0 or 1)
// a bit is the smallest unit of memory that can be stored
// computer hardware is optimized to work with bytes
//1 byte == 8 contiguous bits
// THE ENTIRE COMPUTER MEMORY CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS ONE CONTIGUOUG STRING OF BITS
// All data in memory has memory address. Address are always the same; only data changes
// you won't usually utilize addresses directly; instead variables will do all the heavy lifting for you
//Memory offset can be used to locate items at a specific address
//offsets begin at 0 and they represent theh no of bytes away from the original address
// you usually dont dal with offsets directly but with indexes; the compiler will calculate how many bytes away from the original address
// ADDRESS -> VARIABLE
// OFFSET -> INDEX
